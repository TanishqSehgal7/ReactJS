package-lock.json file, some information..
Here it is : 

1. Dependency Version Locking: Locks exact versions.
2. Specific Version Recording: Records exact nested dependency 
versions.
3. Dependency Resolution: Ensures consistent installs.
4. Consistency & Reproducibility: Same versions for all.
5. Avoid Manual Editing: Risk of conflicts.

In a nutshell, `package-lock.json` lists and locks 
down specific versions of all project dependencies, 
ensuring consistent installations and preventing 
version conflicts. It's hands-off for manual edits to 
avoid potential issues.

===========================================================

ReactDOM/Virtual DOM - react creates its own DOM 
and compares it to the actual browser dom and
updates only those elements which need an updation
or any change.

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)

In virtual DOM there is a method called 
createRoot() which creates a root element which
will be the outermost container for the HTML
webpage.

root.render() -> this renders the React App. Using
jsx, we can render html elements into a webpage
using javascript.


function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello World!!</h1>
      <p className="read-the-docs">
        This is my first React Project
      </p>
    </>
  )
}

export default App

App is a function which return HTML elements that 
are to be rendered inside the root element.

In vite, react script is directly loaded inside
the html page using the script tag just like the 
standard way of loading a basic javascript file.

In order to return multiple components inside the react app,
we need to wrap them up inside an empty tag called
fragment <></>
Without a fragment only one element/component can be 
rendered.

IN a react app which is made using Vite, the javascript
files should always have the extension as .jsx
.js files would throw an error.

While making components, always keep the component name
starting with capital letters which prevents errors
be it in Vite project or be it npx create-react-app
project.


function App() {
  const userName = "Tanishq";
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello World!!</h1>
      <p className="read-the-docs">
        This is my first React Project with username {username}
      </p>
    </>
  )
}

{username} ->  this is the way we can inject javascript inside the
returned HTML content. But this only takes up the evaluated 
expression, ie, no code logic/changes can be done here. Rather,
it only accepts the evaluated values/variables etc.

React.createElement() is automatically injected by Babel
which is a transpiler toolchain that is mainly used to 
convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible 
version of JavaScript in current and older browsers 
or environments.

React controls all the UI updation of the app for which we
need React Hooks which help us make the updated values of 
different variables visible to the UI.

====================================================================

createRoot() method -> this creates a DOM like structure exactly like
the browser. It compares the maine DOM and the DOM created itself, the
(Virtual DOM) and only updates the elements which have some updation
or changes. While browser DOM re-builds the entire DOM again and re-paints
it on the webpage. This is called page reload.

React uses Fiber algorithm behind the scene to update the Virtual DOM
The goal of React Fiber is to increase it suitability for areas like 
animation, layout, and gestures. Its main feature is incremental UI 
rendering. When UI is being updated through some network calls or when
UI is getting simultaneous updates at a time, then it has to be updated
multiple times till the last update is populated. So to optimize this,
React Fiber algorithm was implemented.

It splits rendering into multiple chunks and spread it out over multiple
frames. It can also pause, abort or reuse work as new updation, 
assign priority to different types of updates.

Reconcillation - its is a react algorithm which re-considers what
to be updated in the UI and what not to be updated. This basically 
compares React Tree structure (Virtual DOm) and browser DOM and 
updates UI accordingly.

An update is a change in the data used to render a React app. It is
usually the result of "setState" and eventually results in a 
re-render.

When you render a React App, a tree of nodes that describes the app
is generated and saved in the memory. This tree is flushed into the
rendering environment. When the app is updated, a new tree is generated
and the new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which
operations are neeed to update the rendered app.

Diffing Algorithm High Level Description:
=> Different component types are assumed to generate substantially
different trees. React will not attempt to diff them but rather 
replace the old tree completely.
=> Diffing of lists is performed using keys, Keys should be stable,
predictable, and unique.

In a UI, it is not necessary for every update to be applied immediately
In fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and 
degrading the user experience.

Different updates have different priorities, like an animation 
update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a 
data store.

Push based approach -> requires app (programmer) to decide how 
to schedule work. 

Pull based approach -> allows the framework (React) to be smart and
make those decisions for you.

PRIMARY GOAL OF FIBER IS TO ENABLE REACT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THE SCHEDULING. Specifically we need to be able to:
1. Pause work and come back to it later.
2. Assign priority to different types of work.
3. Reuse previously completed work.
4. Abort work if it is no longer needed.

===========================================================================

Props in React -> props makes the same component re-usable for different
scenarios and is written only once as a separate component.
Props is a way by which we can send specific values and populate them in
React component elements.

===========================================================================

                            Hooks in React:

Hooks let us use different react features into our components like state
management, memoization, optimization etc.

1. State Hooks: State lets a component “remember” information like user input. 
For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while 
an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.

useState Hook: declares a state variable that you can update directly. It keeps
a track of the values and stores their recent state. It lets you add a state 
variable to your component.

Syntax: const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
state is the variable from which the recent value can be obtained
setState is a function which is called to keep a track of the most 
recent state.

Usage
-> Adding state to a component
-> Updating state based on the previous state
-> Updating objects and arrays in state
-> Avoiding recreating the initial state
-> Resetting state with a key
-> Storing information from previous renders

Eg: 1. const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

2. const [todos, setTodos] = useState(() => createTodos());

initialState: The value you want the state to be initially. It can be a value 
of any type, but there is a special behavior for functions. This argument is 
ignored after the initial render.
If you pass a function as initialState, it will be treated as an initializer 
function. It should be pure, should take no arguments, and should return a value 
of any type. React will call your initializer function when initializing the component, 
and store its return value as the initial state.

useState returns an array with exactly two values:
1. The current state. During the first render, it will match the initialState you have passed.
2. The set function that lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render.


Updating State Based on previous state in done by the following way:

function handleClick() {
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(42 => 43)
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(43 => 44)
  setAge(a => a + 1); // setAge(44 => 45)
}

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);

  function increment() {
    setAge(age => age + 1);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Your age: {age}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        increment();
        increment();
        increment();
      }}>+3</button>
      <button onClick={() => {
        increment();
      }}>+1</button>
    </>
  );
}

2. Performance Hooks: A common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. 
For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data 
has not changed since the previous render.

To skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks:

-> useMemo lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
-> useCallback lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.

Sometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can 
improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing 
into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart).

useCallback -> is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies)

Usage
-> Skipping re-rendering of components
-> Updating state from a memoized callback
-> Preventing an Effect from firing too often
-> Optimizing a custom Hook

Syntax: useCallback(fn, dependencies)

fn -> The function value that you want to cache. It can take any arguments and return any values. React will 
return (not call!) your function back to you during the initial render. On next renders, React will give you 
the same function again if the dependencies have not changed since the last render. Otherwise, it will give you 
the function that you have passed during the current render, and store it in case it can be reused later. 
React will not call your function. The function is returned to you so you can decide when and whether to call it.

-> dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the fn code. Reactive values include 
props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. 
If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a 
dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline 
like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the 
Object.is comparison algorithm.

When you optimize rendering performance, you will sometimes need to cache the functions that you pass to child 
components. Let’s first look at the syntax for how to do this, and then see in which cases it’s useful.

To cache a function between re-renders of your component, wrap its definition into the useCallback Hook:

import { useCallback } from 'react';

export default function ProductPage({ productId, referrer, theme }) {
  const handleSubmit = useCallback((orderDetails) => {
    post('/product/' + productId + '/buy', {
      referrer,
      orderDetails,
    });
  }, [productId, referrer]);

  On the initial render, useCallback returns the fn function you have passed.

During subsequent renders, it will either return an already stored fn  function from the last render 
(if the dependencies haven’t changed), or return the fn function you have passed during this render.


3. Effect Hooks: lets a component connect to and synchronize with external systems like 
network components, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library
and other non-React Code.

Syntax: useEffect(setup, dependencies?) 

Eg:
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]);


setup: The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally 
return a cleanup function. When your component is added to the DOM, React will run your 
setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run 
the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup 
function with the new values. After your component is removed from the DOM, React will 
run your cleanup function.

dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the setup code. 
Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared 
directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will 
verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. 
The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline 
like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value 
using the Object.is comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after 
every re-render of the component.
